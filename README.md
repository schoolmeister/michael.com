### Idea
* Shows a map of the whereabouts of onions in your neighborhood.
* People can add their own onions to the page, designating an onion has been spotted.
  * The picture *must* contain an onion
  * No other info may be added, only that the is at least one onion.
* Cool future idea: phone/screen coupling
